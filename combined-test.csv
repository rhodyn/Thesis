I am most passionate about learning, so I studied hard and joined almost all the extra-curricular activities in school, even though they were held online. Maybe it was because I was just really bored?. As I’ve said, I was really into politics during my senior high school years. What really caught my curiosity was understanding how the system works—like how senators works, how the branches of government operate, and honestly, how messed up and flawed it can be. It was eye-opening, and it made me more vocal about my beliefs and more interested in how change can actually happen.. I didn’t really have any specific career goals in mind when I enrolled in my program because, to be honest, it was never really my first choice.
